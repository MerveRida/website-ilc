                Did you spend the semester stuck in front of a screen wishing you could see beyond it? Did you crave the
                opportunity to explore other real and imagined worlds, and experience a new dimension of digital
                learning?​

                We believe that Xtreme Reality (XR) is the future of education and that the Extended Reality (XR) family
                of
                technologies has the potential for cultivating engaging learning environments. The ILC is thus committed
                to
                developing human-centered, design-based simple methods and straight-forward procedures -the ILC ToolKit-
                that enable diverse Campus communities to embed Xtreme Reality (XR) into their learning curricula. The
                opportunities are endless: VR study abroad programs, virtual science experiments, and immersive language
                learning are just a few.

                        Our first phase will produce an interactive toolkit (itself a VR/AR experience) that will teach
                        basic
                        literacy in immersive learning methodologies and their application in order to build with the
                        VR/AR
                        platforms WondaVR and MozillaHubs. The toolkit will contain five lessons: immersive learning
                        theory,
                        immersive learning goals, asset collection and use, design thinking, and project creation.

                        In the second phase, the team will organize a competition akin to a hackathon, inviting UNC-CH
                        students
                        and teachers to submit their own demo immersive experiences. The winner of the contest will
                        receive
                        funding to pay for the further curation of their own project into a full-fledged course. All
                        demo
                        experiences and assets will be added to the ILC workspace, kickstarting it as a campus community
                        for
                        aspiring immersive learning creators.

                        In the third phase, we will create an Immersive Learning Collective Slack community. This Slack
                        workspace will serve as the hub for students, teachers, and creators who have taken the
                        Immersive
                        Learning course, allowing them to share their work, assets, and ideas with each other. This will
                        hopefully scale to create thriving and long-lasting communities of Immersive Learning creators.
