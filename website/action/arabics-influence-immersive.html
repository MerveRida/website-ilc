        <h1>Exploring Arabic's Influence on Spanish through an Immersive Experience</h1>
        <h3>Do we need to know a lot of technical information to create immersive experiences? Is creating immersive
            experiences expensive and hard? It is actually not!</h3>
        <p>
            When we think about immersive experiences, we tend to think of expensive equipment, hard technical skills,
            implementation issues, and time consuming development. In reality, creating immersive experiences is much
            easier, demonstrated in this project created by the team of undergraduate students in SPAN 621. Hannah
            Wilkins, Omar Torrez, Garrison Bradford, and Michael Vollbracht have created an immersive experience with a
            platform we are all aware of: Google Slides.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the class SPAN 621: "Literary and Cultural History of the Spanish Language," the team has built
            an immersive experience to display Andalusia’s Islamic architecture and Arabic extralinguistic influence on
            the Spanish language. The team has chosen architecture to exemplify the influence of Arabic on the Spanish
            language because architecture provides a visual stamp of the Muslim influences in Iberia that allow one to
            investigate the intersections between the fluid non-verbal communication (architecure) that mirrors the
            development of verbal communication (Castillan language) in Spain.

        <p>
            This virtual experience has been created through the use of Google Slides and the incorporation of 360
            Cities. Within the Google Slides, 360 cities have been embedded as the virtual component where users are
            able to navigate the certain building or architectural pieces as they are being orally described and
            discussed. The user has been provided the ability to navigate to a total of 12 buildings and architectural
            pieces in three cities: Córdoba, Granada, and Sevilla that represented various concentrations of Arabic
            influence on the Spanish language and architecture.

            This project shows that creating immersive experiences does not require hard technical skills or time
            consuming development. Immersive experiences can be created through many platforms with any skillset.
